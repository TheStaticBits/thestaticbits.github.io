                        I'm currently a teenager in high school who likes to program in his free time. Hopefully I'll be able to turn this hobby into a likeable job in the future! For now though, I'm just going to continue learning and enjoying myself by programming in my free time.

                        This website is still under development, and you may see some new features every now and then. I may upload some games in the projects area, at least ones that I are made using Javascript or that can be ported to the web, such as using Emscripton for SDL2 games. If I can't do either, I'll upload an exe file.

                        In my school, I'm currently in Business Professionals of America (or BPA for short). Me and a couple friends made a video game for the Software Engineering Team competition, which you'll probably be able to find in the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section of this website. The competition's still being judged.
